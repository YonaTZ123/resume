        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            Are you doing exactly what you know you're supposed to be doing? If so, you know how I feel. It's an incredible blessing and priviledge to know what you're born to do - and be able to do it. I know that for the time being, I am in exactly the place I am meant to be. I also know that I need to develop my skills so that I can better serve. So, with that in mind - this resume was created as part of a Capstone Project for the Web Development course I am taking. If you are reading this, I'm still taking that course. Feel free to reach out!

            My name is Jonathan Vinton. I have spent the majority of my life in Tanzania. This gave me a unique perspective into the challenges that the world faces as it progresses through the 21st century. The world is missing out on so much talent - I serve in a small village in Tanzania as the head of IT for Village Schools Tanzania. The people I work with, the students that go to our schools, they are all brilliant. It's a shame that the world has left them behind, so to speak - they have so much to offer. So, I am working towards the day that the incredible talents, ingenuity, and hard-work of every young man and woman in Africa can be fully-recognized and each person has the opportunity to flourish.
